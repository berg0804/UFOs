# Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project is to create a website with a listing of UFO sightings that are stored in a JavaScript array. The UFO sightings data on the website is searchable by date, city, state, and country. The website was created with Javascript, Bootstrap, and HTML/CSS.
# Results
The website provides boxes in which users can enter their desired search criteria.

The results of the search are displayed in a table form.

# Summary
One drawback of the site is the search must be case specific to match the database. For example, the user cannot search for "Benton" as Benton is listed in the array as "benton".
Two recommendations for the project are to allow a range of dates to be searched for and to have a drop down menu instead of a search box.
